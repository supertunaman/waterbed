Yep, a forum system written in bash. 
Admin stuff like adding boards or removing posts is done from the command line. 
It uses tables. 
OOP is a foreign concept in the scope of this project. 
Smoking within 50 feet is strictly prohibited. 
No shoes, no shirt, no MVC.

A typical installation would have index.cgi in the root dir of the
forum. There would be a dir called "boards". In there would be more dirs.

These directories are your actual forums. Now here's where it gets tricky,
try to keep up. If I'm going too fast then please raise your hand.

The name of the dir is the name of the board. Hyphens become spaces. So,

Pumpers/

becomes the board "Pumpers". Now something more advanced:

Tumblers-Better-than-Pumpers/

becomes the board "Tumblers Better than Pumpers".

Stay tuned for more instructions as this thing gets to a workable state.
